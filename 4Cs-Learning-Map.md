## üìñ C2: CONCEPTS (Chunked Learning)
**Goal**: Present new information in small, digestible chunks with active learning


### üéØ CHUNK 2: SHIFT 2 - From OOP to Functional Programming (Paradigm Change)
**Duration**: ?? minutes | **Paradigm**: Functional Programming

---

#### Concept 2.1: Two Concerns ‚Üí üîß Single Function (20 min)
**"A rule is just a function: int ‚Üí Either<Continue, Final>"**

##### Mini-Lecture (7 min)
- **Problem**: Two separate concerns in interface (Evaluate + Final)
- **FP Principle**: Combine concerns into single function with algebraic data type
- **Solution**: Either/Result monad pattern with RuleResult

##### Code Comparison (2 min)
**Before** (Two concerns):
```csharp
public interface IRule
{
    string Evaluate(int number);  // Concern 1: What output?
    bool Final { get; }          // Concern 2: Should we stop?
}
```

**After** (Single function with Either/Result monad):
```csharp
public interface IRule
{
    RuleResult Evaluate(int number); // One function, clear semantics
}

// Result monad: two possible states
public abstract record RuleResult
{
    public record Continue(string Output) : RuleResult;  // Keep going
    public record Final(string Output) : RuleResult;    // Stop here
}

// Usage:
// RuleResult.Final("42")
// RuleResult.Continue("Fizz")
```

##### Quick Activity (5 min)
**Think-Pair-Share**: How does this design eliminate the need for two separate properties?

#### Concept 2.4: Old Syntax ‚Üí üÜî Idiomatic (10 min)
**"Code should feel natural in the language"**

##### Mini-Lecture (3 min)
- **Problem**: Old-fashioned C# patterns (verbose syntax, unnecessary ceremony)
- **CUPID Principle**: Idiomatic = Use modern language features that reduce noise
- **Solution**: records to model nested types (union types alike) + pattern matching to model imperative code


**Example : Records with Nested Types - Simulating Discriminated Unions (C# 9+)**

**Before** (Old-fashioned classes):
```csharp
// Verbose class hierarchy with boilerplate
public abstract class RuleResult
{
    public class Continue : RuleResult
    {
        public string Output { get; }
        
        public Continue(string output)
        {
            Output = output;
        }
    }
    
    public class Final : RuleResult
    {
        public string Output { get; }
        
        public Final(string output)
        {
            Output = output;
        }
    }
}
```

**After** (Modern C# - Records as Discriminated Union Pattern):
```csharp
// Concise, immutable by default, with structural equality
// This simulates discriminated unions from F#/Haskell
public abstract record RuleResult
{
    public record Continue(string Output) : RuleResult;
    public record Final(string Output) : RuleResult;
}

// Usage: RuleResult.Final("42")
```

**Why it's better**: Records eliminate boilerplate, provide immutability by default, and give you structural equality for free.

This pattern simulates **discriminated unions** (a.k.a. sum types) from functional languages like F#, Haskell, or Scala.

**Note**: Even C# 14 doesn't have true discriminated unions (though they're proposed for future versions). This record pattern is the closest idiomatic approach to model "Either/Or" types in modern C#.

( see foot notes )





---

#### Concept 2.2: Mutable State ‚Üí üîÆ Immutable Data (15 min)
**"Immutable data prevents bugs and surprises"**

##### Mini-Lecture (5 min)
- **Problem**: Mutable properties can change after creation
- **FP Principle**: Immutable data eliminates entire categories of bugs
- **Solution**: Records and read-only properties

##### Code Comparison (5 min)
**Before** (Mutable):
```csharp
public class DivisibilityRule : BaseRule
{
    public int Divisor { get; set; }     // Can change!
    public string Output { get; set; }   // Can change!
}
```

**After** (Immutable):
```csharp
public abstract record RuleResult
{
    public record Continue(string Output) : RuleResult;  // Immutable
    public record Final(string Output) : RuleResult;    // Immutable
}

public class DivisibilityRule : RuleBase
{
    public int Divisor { get; }      // Read-only
    public string Output { get; }    // Read-only
    
    public DivisibilityRule(int divisor, string output)
    {
        Divisor = divisor;
        Output = output;
    }
}
```

##### Quick Activity (5 min)
**Discussion**: What bugs can immutability prevent?

---
---

## üõ†Ô∏è C3: CONCRETE PRACTICE (Hands-On Activities)
**Goal**: Apply concepts through deliberate practice


### Practice Session 2: Railway Oriented Programming (90-120 min)

**Objective**: Transform OOP code into Railway-style functional programming
**Based on**: Scott Wlaschin's Railway Oriented Programming pattern

#### Exercise 4: Implement Either Monad / Result Type (20 min)
**Task**: Create RuleResult type and understand the Railway metaphor
- Define RuleResult abstract record with Continue and Final nested records
- Change IRule.Evaluate to return RuleResult
- Update existing rules to return RuleResult
- Understand the two-track system: Success (Continue) vs Terminal (Final)

**Railway Metaphor**:
- **Continue** = Success track (train keeps going, accumulating cargo)
- **Final** = Terminal station (train stops, returns final output)

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ RuleResult type models Either monad (Continue/Final)
- ‚úÖ All rules return RuleResult
- ‚úÖ Understand two-track railway system
- ‚úÖ Tests pass

**Reference**: `RuleResult.cs`

---

#### Exercise 5: Implement Railway Operations (30 min)
**Task**: Create monadic operations for the Railway pattern
- **Map**: Transform output while staying on same track
- **Bind**: Chain operations that can switch tracks
- **Tee**: Observe without modification (logging)
- **FollowTrainUntilTerminal**: Process until hitting Final
- **CompleteJourney**: Handle both outcomes (Final or accumulated Continue)

**Code to Write** (in `RailwayExtensions.cs`):
```csharp
public static RuleResult Map(this RuleResult input, Func<string, string> transform)
public static RuleResult Bind(this RuleResult input, Func<string, RuleResult> switchFunction)
public static RuleResult Tee(this RuleResult input, Action<string> sideEffect)
public static IEnumerable<RuleResult> FollowTrainUntilTerminal(this IEnumerable<RuleResult> results)
public static string CompleteJourney(this IEnumerable<RuleResult> results, string defaultDestination)
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Map transforms Continue, bypasses Final
- ‚úÖ Bind can switch between tracks
- ‚úÖ Tee executes side effects on Continue only
- ‚úÖ FollowTrainUntilTerminal stops at first Final
- ‚úÖ CompleteJourney returns Final output or accumulated Continue
- ‚úÖ All operations tested

**Reference**: `RailwayExtensions.cs`

---

#### Exercise 6: Refactor Engine to Railway Style (20 min)
**Task**: Transform imperative evaluation into Railway pipeline
- Replace imperative loops and if statements
- Use railway operations in functional pipeline
- Make evaluation a pure function composition

**Before** (Imperative):
```csharp
var result = string.Empty;
foreach (var rule in _rules)
{
    var ruleResult = rule.Evaluate(number);
    if (ruleResult is RuleResult.Final final)
        return final.Output;
    if (ruleResult is RuleResult.Continue cont)
        result += cont.Output;
}
return string.IsNullOrEmpty(result) ? number.ToString() : result;
```

**After** (Railway-Oriented):
```csharp
return _rules
    .Select(rule => rule.Evaluate(number))      // Map each rule
    .FollowTrainUntilTerminal()                 // Stop at terminal
    .CompleteJourney(defaultDestination: number.ToString()); // Handle outcome
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ No mutable state
- ‚úÖ No imperative loops or if statements
- ‚úÖ Single pipeline expression
- ‚úÖ Tests pass

**Reference**: `CupidFizzBuzzEngine.cs`

---

#### Exercise 7: Test Railway Properties (30 min)
**Task**: Write comprehensive tests demonstrating Railway pattern
- Test two-track system (Continue vs Final)
- Test Map/Bind/Tee operations
- Test short-circuit behavior
- Test real FizzBuzz scenarios with railway metaphor

**Tests to Write** (in `RailwayOrientedProgrammingTests.cs`):
1. **Railway Basics**: Success track vs Final track
2. **Map**: Transforms on Continue, bypasses Final
3. **Bind**: Can switch tracks, short-circuits on Final
4. **Tee**: Side effects on Continue only
5. **Journey**: FollowTrainUntilTerminal stops correctly
6. **Real Scenarios**: FizzBuzz(15), ExactMatch(42), NoMatch(7)

**Example Test**:
```csharp
[Test]
public void Railway_SwitchToFinalTrack_StopsProcessing()
{
    var train = RuleResult.ContinueWith("Fizz")
        .Map(s => s.ToUpper())                      // Applied: "FIZZ"
        .Bind(s => RuleResult.StopWith("STOP!"))    // Switch to Final
        .Map(s => s + " IGNORED");                   // BYPASSED!
    
    ((RuleResult.Final)train).Output.Should().Be("STOP!");
}
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Tests demonstrate two-track behavior
- ‚úÖ Tests show short-circuit on Final

## üë£ Foot notes

### on Discriminated Unions

#### What Makes It Similar to Discriminated Unions:
- Closed Set of Cases: The abstract base record RuleResult with sealed nested records creates a finite set of possible values (Continue or Final)
- Type Safety: Pattern matching ensures you handle all cases at compile time
- Immutability: Records are immutable by default, like functional discriminated unions
- Structural Equality: Records provide value-based equality, not reference equality

However, It's Not Perfect:

#### Limitations compared to true discriminated unions (F#/Haskell):

 - Not truly sealed: Without the sealed keyword on the base record, someone could theoretically create a third case
- More verbose: Requires explicit inheritance syntax
- No exhaustiveness checking: C# won't warn you if you forget a case in pattern matching (unless you use switch expressions carefully)


A better pattern:
```csharp
public abstract record RuleResult
{
    private RuleResult() { } // Private constructor prevents external inheritance
    
    public sealed record Continue(string Output) : RuleResult;
    public sealed record Final(string Output) : RuleResult;
}
```
