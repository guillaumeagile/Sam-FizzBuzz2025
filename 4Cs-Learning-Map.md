## üìñ C2: CONCEPTS (Chunked Learning)
**Goal**: Present new information in small, digestible chunks with active learning


### üéØ CHUNK 2: SHIFT 2 - From OOP to Functional Programming (Paradigm Change)
**Duration**: ?? minutes | **Paradigm**: Functional Programming

---

#### Concept 2.1: Two Concerns ‚Üí üîß Single Function (20 min)
**"A rule is just a function: int ‚Üí Either<Continue, Final>"**

##### Mini-Lecture (7 min)
- **Problem**: Two separate concerns in interface (Evaluate + Final)
- **FP Principle**: Combine concerns into single function with algebraic data type
- **Solution**: Either/Result monad pattern with RuleResult

##### Code Comparison (2 min)
**Before** (Two concerns):
```csharp
public interface IRule
{
    string Evaluate(int number);  // Concern 1: What output?
    bool Final { get; }          // Concern 2: Should we stop?
}
```

**After** (Single function with Either/Result monad):
```csharp
public interface IRule
{
    RuleResult Evaluate(int number); // One function, clear semantics
}

// Result monad: two possible states
public abstract record RuleResult
{
    public record Continue(string Output) : RuleResult;  // Keep going
    public record Final(string Output) : RuleResult;    // Stop here
}

// Usage:
// RuleResult.Final("42")
// RuleResult.Continue("Fizz")
```

##### Quick Activity (5 min)
**Think-Pair-Share**: How does this design eliminate the need for two separate properties?

#### Concept 2.4: Old Syntax ‚Üí üÜî Idiomatic (10 min)
**"Code should feel natural in the language"**

##### Mini-Lecture (3 min)
- **Problem**: Old-fashioned C# patterns (verbose syntax, unnecessary ceremony)
- **CUPID Principle**: Idiomatic = Use modern language features that reduce noise
- **Solution**: records to model nested types (union types alike) + pattern matching to model imperative code


**Example : Records with Nested Types - Simulating Discriminated Unions (C# 9+)**

**Before** (Old-fashioned classes):
```csharp
// Verbose class hierarchy with boilerplate
public abstract class RuleResult
{
    public class Continue : RuleResult
    {
        public string Output { get; }
        
        public Continue(string output)
        {
            Output = output;
        }
    }
    
    public class Final : RuleResult
    {
        public string Output { get; }
        
        public Final(string output)
        {
            Output = output;
        }
    }
}
```

**After** (Modern C# - Records as Discriminated Union Pattern):
```csharp
// Concise, immutable by default, with structural equality
// This simulates discriminated unions from F#/Haskell
public abstract record RuleResult
{
    public record Continue(string Output) : RuleResult;
    public record Final(string Output) : RuleResult;
}

// Usage: RuleResult.Final("42")
```

**Why it's better**: Records eliminate boilerplate, provide immutability by default, and give you structural equality for free.

This pattern simulates **discriminated unions** (a.k.a. sum types) from functional languages like F#, Haskell, or Scala.

**Note**: Even C# 14 doesn't have true discriminated unions (though they're proposed for future versions). This record pattern is the closest idiomatic approach to model "Either/Or" types in modern C#.

#### Concept 2.2: Mutable State ‚Üí üîÆ Immutable Data (15 min)
**"Immutable data prevents bugs and surprises"**

##### Mini-Lecture (5 min)
- **Problem**: Mutable properties can change after creation
- **FP Principle**: Immutable data eliminates entire categories of bugs
- **Solution**: Records and read-only properties

##### Code Comparison (5 min)
**Before** (Mutable):
```csharp
public class DivisibilityRule : BaseRule
{
    public int Divisor { get; set; }     // Can change!
    public string Output { get; set; }   // Can change!
}
```

**After** (Immutable):
```csharp
public abstract record RuleResult
{
    public record Continue(string Output) : RuleResult;  // Immutable
    public record Final(string Output) : RuleResult;    // Immutable
}

public class DivisibilityRule : RuleBase
{
    public int Divisor { get; }      // Read-only
    public string Output { get; }    // Read-only
    
    public DivisibilityRule(int divisor, string output)
    {
        Divisor = divisor;
        Output = output;
    }
}
```

##### Quick Activity (5 min)
**Discussion**: What bugs can immutability prevent?

---

#### Concept 2.3: Imperative ‚Üí üÜî Pattern Matching (15 min)
**"Declarative code is more readable than imperative"**

##### Mini-Lecture (5 min)
- **Problem**: Old-fashioned switch/case statements
- **FP Principle**: Pattern matching is more expressive
- **Solution**: Modern C# pattern matching expressions

##### Code Comparison (5 min)
**Before** (Imperative):
```csharp
switch (ruleResult)
{
    case RuleResult.Final(var output):
        return output;
    case RuleResult.Continue(var output) when !string.IsNullOrEmpty(output):
        result += output;
        break;
    case RuleResult.Continue:
        break;
}
```

**After** (Declarative and functional like):
```csharp
result = ruleResult switch
{
    RuleResult.Final(var output) => output,
    RuleResult.Continue(var output) when !string.IsNullOrEmpty(output) => result + output,
    RuleResult.Continue => result,
    _ => result
};
```

Hints to read that code better:
- **Switch**:  upon `ruleResult` a pattern type is trying to be matched
- **Pattern Type**: `RuleResult.Final(var output)` or `RuleResult.Continue(var output)`
- **Deconstruction**: `var output` 
This is Deconstruction in Pattern Matching:
  The pattern ```RuleResult.Final(var output)``` extracts the Output property from the Final record
  and captures the deconstructed value.
  
  - It's similar to:  ```if (ruleResult is RuleResult.Final final) { var output = final.Output; }```
- **Guard**: `when !string.IsNullOrEmpty(output)`
- **Default**: `_ => result`
- **Result Expression**: is what you read on the right-hand side of the `=>` (the value to return) . 
   - Sometimes called the **Arm body** - The body of the switch arm




##### Quick Activity (5 min)
**Compare**: Which version is easier to read? Why?

---

#### Concept 2.4: Object Methods ‚Üí üè† Pure Functions ( quickie, 5 min)
**"Pure functions are predictable, testable, and composable"**

##### Mini-Lecture (2 min)
- **Problem**: Methods with side effects are unpredictable
- **FP Principle**: Pure functions = same input ‚Üí same output, no side effects
- **Solution**: Eliminate mutable state and side effects

##### Code Comparison (3 min)
**Before** (Impure - side effects):
```csharp
public class BuzzRule : BaseRule
{
    private int callCount = 0;  // Mutable state!
    
    public override string Evaluate(int number)
    {
        callCount++;  // Side effect!
        return number % 5 == 0 ? "Buzz" : "";
    }
}
```

**After** (Pure function):
```csharp
public class DivisibilityRule : RuleBase
{
    public override RuleResult Evaluate(int number) => 
        number % Divisor == 0 
            ? RuleResult.ContinueWith(Output) 
            : RuleResult.Empty;
    // No side effects, no mutable state, completely predictable
}
```

## üìö Resources

### on Discriminated Unions

- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/discriminated-unions
- https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/discriminated-unions/

## üë£ Foot notes

### on Discriminated Unions

#### What Makes It Similar to Discriminated Unions:
- Closed Set of Cases: The abstract base record RuleResult with sealed nested records creates a finite set of possible values (Continue or Final)
- Type Safety: Pattern matching ensures you handle all cases at compile time
- Immutability: Records are immutable by default, like functional discriminated unions
- Structural Equality: Records provide value-based equality, not reference equality

However, It's Not Perfect:

#### Limitations compared to true discriminated unions (F#/Haskell):

 - Not truly sealed: Without the sealed keyword on the base record, someone could theoretically create a third case
- More verbose: Requires explicit inheritance syntax
- No exhaustiveness checking: C# won't warn you if you forget a case in pattern matching (unless you use switch expressions carefully)


A better pattern:
```csharp
public abstract record RuleResult
{
    private RuleResult() { } // Private constructor prevents external inheritance
    
    public sealed record Continue(string Output) : RuleResult;
    public sealed record Final(string Output) : RuleResult;
}
```
