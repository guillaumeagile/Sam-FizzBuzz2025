## in order to make this branch usable for the workshop


- [ ] keep the unit tests, but remove the implementation
- [ ] maybe not all the implementation, but the part that fits the 4Cs goals
- [ ] revert the refactoring from Record back to Classes (RuleBase and its subclasses); so that the participants will have to tackle this problem
- [ ] revert  ``` result = ruleResult switch``` to a old-fashioned if (so that, the participants will have to use more idiomatic modern C#)
