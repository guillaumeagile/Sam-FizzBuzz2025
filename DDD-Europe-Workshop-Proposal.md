# DDD Europe 2025 Workshop Proposal

## Workshop Title
**From Legacy Design to Modern Excellence: A CUPID Learning Path for Software Design**

## Workshop Abstract
This intensive, hands-on workshop transforms legacy code design into modern, composable, and domain-focused solutions through a structured learning path. Participants will refactor a real codebase step-by-step, learning one concept at a time to avoid cognitive overload.

Starting with a codebase that violates SOLID principles, we'll first refactor to CUPID-compliant design (Composable, Unix philosophy, Predictable, Idiomatic, Domain-based), then shift to a functional programming paradigm that naturally aligns with domain modeling principles. Along the way, participants will master modern language idioms, immutable data structures, and algebraic patterns that support clear domain expression.

The workshop emphasizes practical, collaborative work where participants will:
- Identify and refactor design violations that obscure domain concepts
- Apply CUPID principles to create more expressive domain models
- Implement functional techniques that support domain reasoning
- Work with algebraic data types that make domain constraints explicit
- Experience a collaborative human-AI approach to design evolution

By the end, participants will have a deep understanding of modern design principles they can immediately apply to make their domain models more expressive and maintainable.

## Learning Outcomes
After completing this workshop, participants will:

- Understand CUPID principles as a modern alternative to SOLID for domain-focused design
- Be able to identify design violations that obscure domain concepts
- Master functional programming techniques that support domain modeling
- Experience the benefits of composable, predictable, and domain-based code design
- Learn incremental refactoring techniques that preserve domain understanding
- Gain hands-on experience with modern language features that express domain constraints
- Understand how to evolve design through collaborative iteration

## Workshop Format
This is a hands-on workshop with approximately 80% practical coding exercises. Participants will work in pairs or small groups to refactor a real codebase, following a structured learning path that introduces one concept at a time.

The workshop will be structured in two major shifts:

### Shift 1: From SOLID to CUPID (Design Improvement)
- Single Responsibility → Unix Philosophy ("One thing well" for clear domain concepts)
- Open/Closed → Composable (Domain behaviors that compose naturally)
- Complex Priority → Predictable (Obvious behavior that supports domain reasoning)
- Old Syntax → Idiomatic (Modern features that express domain intent clearly)

### Shift 2: From OOP to Functional Design
- Multiple Concerns → Single Function (Clear domain-focused functions)
- Mutable State → Immutable Data (Data that preserves domain invariants)
- Imperative Logic → Declarative Expressions (Domain logic that reads like domain language)
- Object Methods → Pure Functions (Predictable behaviors for domain reasoning)

## Prerequisites
- Intermediate level programming experience
- Basic familiarity with software design concepts
- Some experience with any modern programming language
- Laptop with a development environment (any modern IDE will work)

## Target Audience
This workshop is designed for experienced software developers, architects, and technical leads who want to improve their domain modeling and code design skills. It's particularly relevant for those working with complex domains or looking to modernize their approach to software design.

The workshop will be valuable for:
- Developers working with complex domain models
- Architects looking to modernize their design approaches
- Technical leads wanting to improve team code quality
- Anyone interested in making domain concepts more explicit in code
- Teams exploring collaborative approaches to design evolution

## Duration
2 days (Pre-conference workshop)

## About the Instructor
Guillaume is a software design enthusiast who has developed this learning path through iterative collaboration. This approach combines human domain insight with systematic analysis to create breakthrough learning experiences. The path emerged from real development challenges and represents a practical approach to evolving domain models while maintaining team productivity.

Through this iterative process, Guillaume discovered that combining domain expertise with systematic analysis leads to innovative solutions that make domain concepts more explicit. This workshop shares those insights and techniques with participants.
