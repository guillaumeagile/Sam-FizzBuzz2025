# SOLID > CUPID notes

SOLID Principles
Single Responsabilty Principle
    Uselessly vague - what is a "one thing" or "one reason to change"?
    Concepts should be able to fit in your head, which remains pretty vague 

Open/Closed Principle
    This one is simply out-dated, from the old desire to write code once and reuse forever. 
    Code is not an asset, but a debt. If changing it reduces the debt, you're better off.

Liskov Substitution Principle
    This one is a general misunderstanding of a rather technical definition of subtyping, erronously applied to subclassing, which is very different. 
    
Interface Segregation Principle
    More of a pattern to deconstruct an overly complex object than a principle

Dependency Inversion Principle
    Should probably be called Option Inversion Principle, as the Dependency suggests multiple optional dependencies


North suggests that in general, writing simpler code achieves the desired qualities equally well. 



CUPID is not about principles, but about properties (or charactaristics or qualities)
Some properties can make working with software joyful. 
Principles imply rules, properties evoke a goal to achieve
But context remains king, it all depends on the context
