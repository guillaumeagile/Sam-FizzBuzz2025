# 🎓 The 4Cs Learning Framework
### Based on "Training from the Back of the Room" by Sharon Bowman

---

## 🔗 C1: CONNECTIONS
**Duration**: 10-15 min | **Goal**: Activate prior knowledge

- **Code Review Challenge**: Identify SOLID violations
- **Pair & Share**: Reflect on legacy code experiences
- **Learning Goal Preview**: What does "good code" mean to you?

**Outcome**: Connect to existing knowledge & motivation

---

## 📖 C2: CONCEPTS
**Duration**: 60-120 min | **Goal**: Chunked learning

### Shift 1: SOLID → CUPID (OOP Improvement)
- 🔧 Single Responsibility → **Unix Philosophy**
- 🏠 Open/Closed → **Composable**
- 🔮 Complex Priority → **Predictable**
- 🆔 Old Syntax → **Idiomatic**

### Shift 2: OOP → Functional Programming
- Single function with **Either monad**
- Mutable state → **Immutable data**
- Imperative → **Pattern matching**
- Object methods → **Pure functions**

---

## 🛠️ C3: CONCRETE PRACTICE
 **Goal**: Hands-on application

### Practice Session 1: CUPID Refactoring (45-60 min)
- Extract single responsibilities
- Make rules composable
- Simplify priority system

### Practice Session 2: Functional Programming (60-90 min)
- Implement Either monad
- Pattern matching refactor
- Ensure immutability
- Create pure functions

### Practice Session 3: Integration (30-45 min)
- Create custom rules
- Apply to own codebase

---

## 🎯 C4: CONCLUSIONS
**Duration**: 20-30 min | **Goal**: Reflection & integration

- **Learning Harvest**: What surprised you? What resonates?
- **Before/After Comparison**: What improved most?
- **CUPID vs SOLID**: When to use each?
- **Action Plan**: Tomorrow, this week, this month

**Key Takeaway**: Code is for humans to understand, not just computers to execute! 🚀
