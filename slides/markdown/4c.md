## C1: CONNECTIONS  
**Goal**: Activate prior knowledge and connect to what learners already know

### What Learners Already Know
- **Traditional OOP**: Classes, inheritance, interfaces, mutable state, methods with side effects
- **SOLID Principles**: SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP
- **C# Basics**: Properties, methods, constructors
- **FizzBuzz Problem**: Classic coding kata
- **Limited FP Exposure**: May have used LINQ but not deep functional programming concepts

--

## C2: CONTEXT  


### Shift 1: SOLID → CUPID (OOP Improvement)
- 🔧 Single Responsibility → **Unix Philosophy**
- 🏠 Open/Closed → **Composable**
- 🔮 Complex Priority → **Predictable**
- 🆔 Old Syntax → **Idiomatic**
- 🚀 **Domain-based**: Types model domain concepts clearly

--

## C2: CONTEXT  

### Shift 2: OOP → Functional Programming
- ƛ Single function → **Either-ish monad**
- 🔒 Mutable state → **Immutable data**
- 🎯 Imperative → **Pattern matching**
- ✨ Object methods → **Pure functions**

--

## 🛠️ C3: CONCRETE PRACTICE
**Goal**: Hands-on application

### Practice Session 1: CUPID 
- Extract single responsibilities
- Make rules composable
- Simplify priority system

--

### Practice Session 2: Functional Programming 
- Implement Either monad
- Pattern matching refactor
- Ensure immutability
- Create pure functions

--

### Practice Session 3: Integration 
- Create custom rules
- Apply to own codebase

--

## 🎯 C4: CONCLUSIONS
**Goal**: Reflection & integration

- **Learning Harvest**: What surprised you? What resonates?
- **Before/After Comparison**: What improved most?
- **Action Plan**: Tomorrow, this week, this month

--

###  CUPID vs SOLID 
**Quick Discussion**: When would you use CUPID over SOLID?


**Key Takeaway**:
- SOLID = Good for traditional OOP
- CUPID = Better for modern, functional-leaning code
- Functional Programming + CUPID = Perfect harmony!
