# SOLID Principles    

--

# Single Responsability principle
code should only do one thing, or
code should have only one reason to change

--

# Open/Closed principle
code should be open for extension but 
clossed for modification

--

# Liskov Substitution principle
Derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes

--

# Interface Segregation principle
many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface

--

# Dependency Inversion principle
classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions
